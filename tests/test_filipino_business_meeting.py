Speaker A: Concerned lang because we are thinking of a high risk. Yun niya na mention namin before because of the need to have in terms of documentation wise yun sa contract. I just want to be transparent lang.

Speaker B: Tama ba kasi baka there's just a disconnect. We just have to set the record straight because from our understanding sir is that ang magiging strategy natin for every lit building that we have, we will treat it as LMP.

Speaker A: What's LMP again sir? Last mile partner. So ngayon, okay naman kami dun. It's just that based on our understanding, we cannot tell our client or the lit building na we are in partner and we will be getting it from Rice.

Speaker B: So just to reiterate this, I really want to understand because maybe iba yung process namin, iba yung sa inyo. So we really want to make this like, how is it in your shoes right? If you can describe to us what is your sales process.

Speaker A: The primary reason is really to understand it from your side kasi baka iba yung mindset namin. Number two is, we had some problems also with you being our tail partner in some areas, which became a really big concern escalated na to the top management.

Speaker B: Siguro one thing that we would want to align is, how do you sell in buildings wherein Philcom is not yet there in the building? From the site acquisition perspective, if the building requires us to have MOC or TOR, we will comply regardless if it is DTC or LMP.

Speaker A: Even if you are not in the building, you will still talk to the building and let them know that we are going to use example lang PLDT to install your client. What is your contract with the building? Do you pay anything?

Speaker B: It depends. Some of the buildings nagpapabayad sila ng access fee, some wala naman. From telcos naman, we know that it's a win-win solution if we don't have presence there, we can get it from other telcos and vice versa.

Speaker A: For example, the affiliates yung mga ibang like China Bank, of course not all is in the on-net buildings namin. So meron talaga na ibibigay nung client dun sa 300 plus nila. We have to be transparent especially kung yun naman ang concern with the government.

Speaker B: Ang nangyari kasi is nagbid kami knowing that the building is nandun na kami sa labas. But the building itself hindi siya on-net ni Philcom. Only to find out the building stops us kasi meron na kami dito na certain telco sir, so hindi ka pwedeng pumasok.

Speaker A: Two things I want to ask. If we're going to do this, especially for selected clients, we'd require a redundant connection. Second thing is we want to align with you guys on the cadence of our builds. We acquire and wire buildings regardless of our sales velocity.

Speaker B: We're acquiring around 10 to 20 buildings a month. We're wiring around 10 buildings a month as well. I want to know what is your build velocity on the OSP. Kasi hindi mag-work kung sa amin lang yung nandun.

Speaker A: So internally, may discuss namin yung worst case scenarios. The possibility is there but let's meet in the middle. We really want this partnership to work.

## Summary of the Meeting
The meeting focused on establishing a partnership between Philcom and Rice for telecommunications services, addressing concerns about transparency with building administrators, Last Mile Partner (LMP) vs Direct to Customer (DTC) models, and risk management. Key challenges discussed include building access rights, partner coordination, and the need for redundant connections.

## Key Decisions
‚Ä¢ Both companies will align their sales processes for buildings where they don't have presence
‚Ä¢ Philcom will be transparent with clients about using Rice as a partner, but careful with building administration communication
‚Ä¢ Rice agreed to shoulder penalties for the first 3 months if building admin discovers the partnership arrangement
‚Ä¢ Redundant connections will be required for strategic clients to mitigate risks
‚Ä¢ Both parties will align their build velocity to ensure coordinated deployment

## Notable Discussion Points
‚Ä¢ Transparency concerns with building administration about partner arrangements
‚Ä¢ Previous bad experiences with tail partners that escalated to top management
‚Ä¢ Different approaches between LMP (Last Mile Partner) and DTC (Direct to Customer) models
‚Ä¢ Building access fees vary - some buildings charge, others don't
‚Ä¢ Government contracts require full transparency about last mile partners
‚Ä¢ Risk of being blocked by buildings that have exclusive telco arrangements
‚Ä¢ Need for 10-20 buildings per month acquisition and wiring velocity
